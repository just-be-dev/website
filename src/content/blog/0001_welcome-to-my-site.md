I've rebuilt my personal site with a focus on simplicity and content. This site is:

- **Markdown-driven**: All content is written in Markdown using [mdsvex](https://mdsvex.pngwn.io/)
- **TUI-styled**: Designed to look like a terminal user interface with monospace fonts
- **Fast**: Built with SvelteKit and deployed to Cloudflare

## Why Rebuild?

I wanted a site that puts content first. No distractions, just words on a screen. The TUI aesthetic reminds me of the tools I use every day and the roots of computing.

## What's Here?

You'll find:

- **Blog posts** about software, tools, and technology
- **Projects** I'm working on
- **Research notes** from my explorations in computing

Thanks for visiting! Feel free to reach out if you want to chat.
